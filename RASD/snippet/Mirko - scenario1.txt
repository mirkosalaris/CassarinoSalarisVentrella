Mario is the director of his company and he has seen an ad of Travlendar+, so he
wants to try it to organize the weekly meetings with his employees.
After the installation, he has to register to the app.
The first thing he creates is his weekly program. We work from Monday to 
Friday, from 8 am to 16 pm.

There is an actual meeting coming up on Friday at 8 pm, so he creates a new
meeting in the app. After setting the time and the day, he invites his employees
to join the meeting. He will remain in his office, so he will not need to use
 any travel means.
Giovanni is one of Mario's employee and he is registered to Travlendar+.
He receives a notification and accepts the invitation to the meeting.
He chooses to reach the location by walk because he will already be nearby.
Alex is another employee and does not have an account on Travlendar. He
receives an email with an invitation link to register to the app. After the
registration, the app redirects him to the meeting's invitation and he will
proceed by accepting it and choosing to go by car. Then he explores the app and
decides to add his weekly program. The app finds out that he will be in the caf√©
near the metro at 6:40 pm, so it suggests Alex to take the metro instead of the
car. He accepts the suggestion.
