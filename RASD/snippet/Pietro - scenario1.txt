Alex is a professor of Bologna University, he has a short memory and a bad organization so he decides to
entrust himself to Travlendar+. Alex downloads it on occasion of a work's trip. He enrols himself and decides to insert his credit card
data for an eventual purchase from the app. He needs to reach University of Parma 
in order to make a conference regarding Artificial Intelligence in which he is specialized. Alex sets up the app to arrive 
in Parma by train. Travlendar+ asks Alex the kind of event and he specifies it is a formal work meeting. 
The app asks him which transport means he wants to take in order to reach university from railway station. 
Alex decides that he'll take a bike, althought the app suggests not because of the formal type of meeting. The departure day Alex is 
in a shopping center with his family, he complitely forgotten that he has a train but Travlendar+ solves the problem
by notifying him the appointment. At that point, Alex has not more time and chooses to buy the tickets using the app.
While he is on the train Travlendar+ suggests him to choose another transport means (instead of a bike) from the station to the university
because of the bad weather conditions. Alex accepts the advise and decides to take a bus. At the end Alex carries out his task 
without any problems thanks Travendlar+ that becomes essential for him!
