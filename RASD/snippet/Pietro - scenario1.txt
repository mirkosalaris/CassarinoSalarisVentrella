Alex is a professor of Bologna University, he has a short memory and is very badly organized, so he decides to
rely on Travlendar+. Alex downloads it on occasion of a work trip. He signs up and decides to insert his credit card
data for an eventual purchase from the app. He needs to reach the University of Parma

Alex opts to go by bicycle, although the app suggest not to, because of the formal type of meeting. The departure day Alex is 
in a shopping center with his family, he has completely forgotten that he has a train to take, but Travlendar+ solves the problem

-------
- "the app didn't suggest it" instead of "the app suggests not to" because it would be a functionality our app doesn't possess.
- add "train" before "tickets"
- minor grammatical/syntactical corrections
- remove "regarding Artificial Intelligence in wich he is specialized", not useful
