Luca is a meteorologist who works for a laboratory in Venice. He knows very well all the climatic problem that 
humans are creating in their Country. Luca finds Travlendar+ very appropriate to help in solving this problematic. He likes to opt 
for an Eco-friendly solution by setting up this preference in the app settings. In this way he can avoid, at least in this aspect,
further damaging the environment. His favorite functionality is bike sharing because of its innovative localization system and its 
low environmental impact.
