Paolo, a resident of Bergamo, has recently registered to Travlendar+ and during
the initial setup has specified a flexible launch break from 11:00 am to
13:00 am, with at least 40 minutes of break.
Tomorrow he is going to have an audition at 12:30 pm, in Monza. He inserts the 
event in the app and after having specified that the audition will end at about
13:30pm, he asks to the app some suggestions on the travel means to take: the
app suggests him some travel solutions, but he doesn't specify which he's going
to take because he wants to think about it overnight.

The next morning, the app sends Paolo a reminder with two travel solutions:
- go by car, leaving at about 11.45am, arriving at 12.27 pm;
- take the bus, passing at 10:49 am and arriving at 11:38 am.

He chooses the second option to avoid being late at the audition.
