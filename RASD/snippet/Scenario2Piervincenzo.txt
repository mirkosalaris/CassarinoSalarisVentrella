Mary, John's wife, one week ago, asked to her husband to pick the children up to school on Monday at 13.00 and, because she knows John,  forced him to take note of that with Travlendar+.
So John planned this event on the app specifying that he will use the car to do it.
He specified also the location of the school.
On Monday morning, as usual, Travlndar+ shows to John his daily program reminding him about his children and showing the previous  travel mean planned.
John, still intentioned to pick the children up with the car, does not modify the plan, closes the app and goes to work in the other side of Milan.
At 12.00 Travlendar+, according to the GPS position of the man, suggests him to leave in 15 minutes.
Travel+ also suggests to avoid to go through  Viale Gioia because of the traffic and take the SS1.
Thanks to Travlendar+ John manages to be on time, collect the children and make his wife proud of him.
