Mary, John's wife, one week ago, asked her husband to pick the children up from school on 
Monday at 13.00 and, because she knows John, forced him to take note of that with Travlendar+.
So John planned this event on the app specifying that he would have used the car.
He also specified the location of the school.
On Monday morning, as usual, Travlendar+ shows to John his daily program reminding him about his children and showing the previously planned travel plan.
John, still intentioned to pick the children up with the car, does not modify the plan, closes the app and goes to work on the other side of Milan.
At 12.00 Travlendar+, according to the GPS position of the man, suggests him to leave in 15 minutes.
Travlendar+ also suggests to avoid Viale Gioia because of the traffic and to take the SS1.
Thanks to Travlendar+ John manages to be on time, collect the children and make his wife proud of him.
