Mark, son of Lucas, asks to his father to bring him  to the basketball tournament of Sunday morning.
Lucas checks the daily schedule for Sunday and he notices he already has an appointment with the hairdresser but, of course, spending time with his son is more important, so he decides to delete the previous event on the agenda and set a new one.
Mark asks to the father if also his team mate Mike can come.
Of course Mark and Mike have to bring with them the bags with the jersey and the basketball shoes, so Lucas, creating the event on Travlendar+, after specifying the location of the basketball court, specifies also that he will bring with him baggage and passengers.
Unfortunately his car is broken, so Lucas use  the app to look for alternative solutions.
Travlendar+, taking into account the constraints previously settled by the man, suggests to him to use Enjoy or SmartToGo, two well known car sharing companies that will solve his problem.
Lucas accepts the suggested solution and proceeds with the creation of the event.
