Mark, son of Lucas, asks his father to bring him to the basketball tournament of Sunday morning.
Lucas checks the daily schedule for Sunday and he notices he already has an appointment with the
hairdresser but, of course, spending time with his son is more important, so he decides to delete
the previous event on the agenda and to create a new one.
Mark asks the father whether also his teammate Mike can come.
Of course, Mark and Mike have to bring with them the bags with the jersey and the basketball shoes, 
so Lucas, editing the details of the event on Travlendar+, after specifying the location of the basketball 
court, specifies also that he will carry baggage and passengers.
Unfortunately, his car is broken, so Lucas uses the app to look for alternative solutions.
Travlendar+, taking into account the constraints previously set by the man, suggests him to use
Enjoy or SmartToGo, two well-known car sharing companies that will solve his problem.
Lucas selects that solution and exit the app.
