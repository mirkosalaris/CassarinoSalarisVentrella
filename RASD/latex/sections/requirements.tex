\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
	\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
		Here we provide some basic mockups to show how the interface should appear to the user:\newline

			\caption{Visualize schedule}
		\end{figure}
	
	\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
	The main hardware interface of the system consists in the access to the GPS data
	in the mobile application. The application also requires Internet connectivity
	and internal storage access.
	
	\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
	The mobile application must support Android,iOS and the remaining main OSs (further details are discussed in paragraph 3.6.5 Portability). The web application
	works on any web server that supports Java. The back-end stores its data in a
	DBMS and can run on every platform that supports the JVM.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The system has to be able to respond to a possibly great number of simultaneous requests and
more generally to a great number of request throughout the day.
The S2B, at least for the start, will only be available for the Lombardy region. Based on demographic analysis (number of inhabitants, number of people under the age of 60, number of smartphones sold over the past 2 years), it was decided to design the S2B to support 100,000 users simultaneously, but scalability needs to be guaranteed.
\subsection{Design Constraints}
	\subsubsection{Standard compliance}
	To ensure interoperability the S2B will follow the W3C web standard and will be as adherent as possible to  coding practices in relation to the use of HTML/XHTM, CSS and Java programming language
	Moreover the use of private libraries will be avoided.
	\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Mobile App: \newline
		* 3G connection\newline
		* GPS\newline
		* Space for app package
		\item Web App:\newline
		* Modern browser with AJAX support
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
	Regulatory policies
	The system will ask for users' payment informations and obviously, in addition to store them
	safely, will use them only for fees and rides payments.
	Moreover, the system will have to ask for users' permission in order to retrieve and use their
	positions.
	Email addresses won't be used for commercial uses.
\subsection{Software System Attributes} 
	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	The system must guarantee a 24/7 service. Very small deviations from this requirement will be
	obviously acceptable.
	\subsubsection{Availability}
	The S2B must guarantees a 3-nines availability (99.9 percent) with a downtime not greater than 8 hours per year.
	\subsubsection{Security}
User credentials and payment information will be stored. Data confidentiality is a primary concern.
In addition,when the user wants to buy tickets or rent a shared vehicle, the stored information must be sent to affiliated  transport Company systems or shared vehicle Company  systems . To ensure the security and the confidentiality of this information, the S2B must be able to adopt  access managment protocols and comunication protocols able to prevent not granted access and/or Sniffing/Spoofing activities performed by third.
	
	\subsubsection{Maintainability}
	The S2B must be designed in the way to easly correct defects or their cause,
	repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts,
	prevent unexpected working condition,
	maximize its useful life,
	maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety,
	meet new requirements,
	make future maintenance and
	cope with a changed environment.
	
	\subsubsection{Portability}
	The S2B must be able to run in all main mobile OS(Android, iOS, Nokia OS, blackBerry OS, windows-phone OS) and being supported by all the main Web Browser(Google Crome, Safari,FireFox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, ...)\newline
