We worked together most of the time, more than 30 hours. This is because in the beginning we struggled to find a way to divide responsibilities so we worked together and when we managed to work separately we still needed to discuss and to cross check our work.\newline
Below, for each component of the team, we provide his list of main responsibilities, but it is important to say that we have absolutely collaborated on everything as said before.
