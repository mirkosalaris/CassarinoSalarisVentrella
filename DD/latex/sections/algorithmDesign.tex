\subsection{Weather and Traffic modules - Dynamic configuration}
	\label{sect:WeatherTrafficAlgorithm}
	As we \hyperref[sect:WeatherTrafficModules]{previously described} the Weather and Traffic modules are subject to load balancing and \defined{dynamic configuration} by the System Administrator. This two mechanism causes 4 events to happen. How they are managed is described below:
	\begin{description}[before={\renewcommand{\makelabel}[1]{-- \textit{##1}:}}]
		\item[a Notifier is deleted] this is the only activity that is not managed by the Manager because there is no reason for doing it. If the Notifier is simply being closed, it detaches itself from the Querier. If the Notifier crashes or it is suddenly closed, the Querier will notice this when trying to notify it and it will detach the dead Notifier. No other actions are needed.
		\item[a Notifier is created] the new Notifier communicates its zone to the Manager. The Manager will return to the Notifier a reference to the appropriate Querier using the Address Solver to interpret the zone of the Notifier. Thus, the Notifier can subscribe itself to the Querier.
		\item[a new Quierier is deleted] all the Notifiers previously attached to the Querier have to be analyzed. If a less specific Querier exists \textit{(see below)}, they are attached to it, otherwise they are put in a standby list (they will not receive any information about weather, or traffic)
		\item[a new Querier is instantiated] the standby list is scanned searching for Notifier that can be attached to the Querier (matching the two zone through the Address Solver). If a less specific Querier exists \textit{(see below)}, all the Notifier subscribed to it are analyzed and are eventually moved to the new Querier.

	\textbf{Meaning of specificity of a Querier}\newline
	Let's assume, for instance, that there are four Querier: \inlinecode{ItalyQ}, \inlinecode{MilanQ}, \inlinecode{LazioQ}, \inlinecode{ParisQ}, respectively related to zones: Italy, Milan, Lazio, Paris. \inlinecode{MilanQ} and \inlinecode{LazioQ} are more specific with respect to \inlinecode{ItalyQ} because Milan and Lazio are inside the region Italy. On the other hand, \inlinecode{ItalyQ} is less specific with respect to \inlinecode{MilanQ} and \inlinecode{LazioQ}. \inlinecode{ParisQ} has no relation of specificity with all the others.\newline
	Hence:
	\begin{itemize}[label=--]
		\item \inlinecode{LazioQ} crashes $\rightarrow$ all the Notifiers subscribed to \inlinecode{LazioQ} are now moved to \inlinecode{ItalyQ}
		\item \inlinecode{RomeQ} Querier is created $\rightarrow$ \inlinecode{ItalyQ} is less specific than \inlinecode{RomeQ}, so \inlinecode{ItalyQ} is scanned searching for Notifiers associated to region Rome: if there are such Notifiers, they are moved to \inlinecode{RomeQ}. Notice: the Notifiers that were associated to \inlinecode{LazioQ} but are actually outside the region of Rome would remain associated to \inlinecode{ItalyQ}.
		\item \inlinecode{ParisQ} crashes $\rightarrow$ all the Notifiers associated to \inlinecode{ParisQ} are moved to the standby list, because no 'less specific' Queriers are available.
	\end{itemize}
	\smallskip
	Notice that Queriers are meant to be wide regions and not single cities, this was just an example.
