Trying to save time, in our sessions we tried to concentrate only on organizing our work, comparing our ideas, and discussing important issues and decisions that had to be taken as a team. We worked together 14 hours.
\newline
Below, for each component of the team, we provide his list of main responsibilities and his hours of work indicated as total and as spent working alone. Please note that part of the work of each person has been dedicated to cross checking the work of the others.
