		\item[Incoming Appointment] the next scheduled appointment for which the S2B send a reminder to the user. The reminder is sent  a certain amount of time before the appointment starts, to allow the user to get on time in the location.
		\item[Future Notification] a notification that is generated but it will be eventually sent only in a future time. The time has to be specified during the creation.
		\item[Dynamic Configuration] with this term we mean a reconfiguration that can be done without powering off the server or any physical component.

\subsection{Document Structure}
	\begin{description}[before={\renewcommand{\makelabel}[1]{ \textbf{\textit{##1}}:}}]
		
		\item[1. Introduction] This serves as an introduction to the document to illustrates its purpose, scope, the conventions that will be used and its structure.
		\item[2. Architectural Design] After providing an overview of the system, in this sections we also include all the details of the architecture and the related design decisions. We start from the data model and we describe the components and their role. After a static description a runtime analysis of the interesting components is provided. Finally we describe the main component interfaces.
		\item[3. Algorithm Design] In this section we described the most interesting Algorithms we identified in the system, how they works and their context.
		\item[4. User Interfaces Design] After the technical description of the previous section, here we provide indications on the User interactions with the App and mockups of the screens related to the main functionalities.
		\item[5. Requirements Traceability] This section explains the rational behind our design decisions in terms of a mapping between the goal/requirements defined in the RASD and the components illustrated in this document.
		\item[6. Implementation, Integration and Test Plan] In this last technical section, we provide a Plan for the whole development process, giving indications on the general approach, the priorities and the details of the process.
		\item[7. Effort Spent and Team Work] Here we include a summary of the Effort Spent by each member of the team and indications on his responsibilities.
		\item[8. References] This is the section in which we include details on Software and Tools used and the Reference Documents on which we based our work.
